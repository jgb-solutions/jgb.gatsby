				<h2>Who I Am</h2>
				<Typography paragraph>
					<p>
						My name is Jean GÃ©rard Bousiquot, a Software Developer from Delmas, Haiti.
						This website is the home for my business, <span>JGB Solutions</span>, where I offer Web, Mobile and other software development services.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've been developing for the web for a few years now.
						And about 2+ years worth of experience in mobile development.
					</p>
					<p>
						I'm proficient in PHP, JavaScript and TypeScript. PHP mainly for web applications, APIs and other kind of web services. Laravel is my go-to web framwork. JavaScript and TypeScript for web front-ends and hybrid mobile applications. Angular, Vue and React, Ionic, React Native are some of the tools I use. And Node is often used as a build tool locally, even though I'm learning it thoroughly in order to use it as a web application framework.
					</p>

					<p>
						I've been into computers for about 13 years now. So before development I've been dabbling with various computer related stuff such as graphic design, computer repair and more.
					</p>
					<p>
					Beside computers I like surfing the internet, playing NES video
						games, watching movies, TV shows and listening to music.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also love to read books and articles, but mainly techninal ones;
						speak and write in 4 languages: Creole, French, English and
						a little bit of Spanish.
